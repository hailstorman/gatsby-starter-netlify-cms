Over the years Iâ€™ve told many stories to kids, these are based on them.

During that time the Teddys in the story have changed. They  started as small ceramic unicorns and have worked their way through many other toys and friends, both real and imagined.

The stories are designed to be read aloud at bed time.  How long it takes to read them very much depends on how many questions you get along the way.  

In my experience a 5 minute story can easily become a 45 minute epic, depending on the skill of the small interrogator(s). 

Take these stories, enjoy them, personalise, embellish, change or omit what you will.  Make the story theirs.
