  title: What is Teddy Story?
  description: >
    Teddy Story is a collection of stories about the adventures of teddies and
    their owners.


    The teddies in the stories aren’t just teddy bears, they are friends and companions of all shapes and sizes, almost anything can qualify as a teddy.


    Their stories are short, but spread all over time and space.  We hope you enjoy them.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
