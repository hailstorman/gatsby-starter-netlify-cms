  title: What is Teddy Story?
  description: >
    Teddy Story is a collection of stories inspired by bedtime stories that I've
    told over the years.  The Teddys in those stories started out as small
    ceramic unicorns, evolving over time into a complex series of interwoven
    stories about the adventures of the audience, and their Teddy companions.

  about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
